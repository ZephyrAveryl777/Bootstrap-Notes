### Creating  Full Page Width Jumbotron
To create a jumbotron without rounded corners and that covers the full width of the viewport, place it outside all the containers, add the `.jumbotron-fluid` modifier class on it, and add a `.container` or `.container-fluid` within it.

`Example`
```html
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Learn to Create Websites</h1>
        <p class="lead">In today's world internet is the most popular way of connecting with the people...</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Start learning today</a></p>
    </div>
</div>
```
